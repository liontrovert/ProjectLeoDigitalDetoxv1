==INSTRUCTIONS==
Hey, I don't know how to host the site using Github, so for now, to test this you can do 1 of two things:

(1) Download all these files and host the site on your computer, although not ideal if you're on a shared computer

or

(2) Fork this project on Replit (you're gonna need a Replit account) and use the developer's webview option. You can even open the webview in a separate tab.
Access the Replit here: https://replit.com/@NicholasAlvare1/DigitalDetoxPOCProjectLeo 

Either of these options should work, it would be nice to know how the proof-of-concept webpage works in different browsers.
